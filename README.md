# Hello. I'm Darnell!

I'm a former ferry deckhand / current programmer with a strong interest in web / game development. I've worked on a number of projects that have allowed me to learn how to use JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Express, HTML, SCSS, MongoDB, SQL and much more in order to bring creative projects to life.

Let me know if you're interested in collaborating on a web app, or a video game!
