# Hello. I'm Darnell!

I'm a former ferry deckhand / aspiring programmer with a strong interest in web / game development. Teaching myself how to code and working on projects has made me fairly proficient with JavaScript, SASS, and React. I'm excited to see how far I can go.

If you're interested in collaborating together on a web application or a game (or both!), please feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/elemeandor)
