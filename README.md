# Hello. I'm Darnell!

I'm a former ferry deckhand / aspiring programmer with a strong interest in web / game development. I actively study both so that I can keep up with the newest techniques and technologies.

If you're interested in collaborating together on a web application or a game (or both!), please feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/elemeandor)
